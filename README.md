# CustomGanttChart
This is an example of a custom Gantt Chart using DHTML library that I have Created for enterprise use. Note that this is a basic preview and could get more advanced with added JS.

Attached below is a snippet of how this looks in a web environment:

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the code's functionality. It serves as an introductory preview, showcasing the core features and potential applications of the codebase.

In practical usage, the script facilitates the seamless integration of real-time data, enabling users to visualize a wide range of desired outcomes. By importing relevant data into the script, users can unlock its full potential.

Within the code and accompanying example, the implementation revolves around the management of time-sensitive tasks. Specifically, four distinct scenarios are presented as representative cases.

When the progress bar is displayed in blue, it signifies that the user has ample time available to complete the respective task or has successfully completed it within the designated timeframe.

Conversely, a red progress bar indicates that the user has either failed to complete the task within the due date or has marked it as completed after the specified deadline.

For further exploration and implementation, please refer to the attached code file (GanttChart.html) in this repository, providing a comprehensive view of this project.
